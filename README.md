This repository houses code for building a multi-spectral LandTrendr ensemble. Scripts include Earth Engine code for running LandTrendr and generating feature sets from resulting segmentation outputs. The repository also includes example code in `/model` for the degenerate trees approach described in Pasquarella et al. (in prep), which can be used to optimize threshold selection across a input feature set.
